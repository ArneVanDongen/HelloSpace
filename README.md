# HelloSpace

## Goals
* 500m hop, seperate both stages, and recover both.
* Sub-orbital flight to the next continent, firing upper stage 10 s more
* Get into orbit
* Get into orbit with enough fuel to land booster

## TODO

 - [x] Calculate when to last start suicide burn instead of taking altitude
 - [ ] Write own SAS module
 - [ ] calculate throttle for ascent also
 - [ ] add air resistance to throttle calculator
 - [x] Take ground dynamic distance to ground instead of launch attitude
 - [x] Add RCSs to vehicle to prevent tip over on landing, and stabilize horizontal movement (21-05-2020)
 - [x] Instead of changing throttle reactively, calculate how much thrust is needed and apply it (19-05-2020)
